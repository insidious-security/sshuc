# SSHUC
This program takes a hostname as input and constructs an SSH command to connect to a remote server with a predefined username.
This resolves the need to manually create aliases across different hosts. Just pull, compile, and run the binary. If needed, you can easily change or add flags for the "ssh command" in the source code. 


## How It Works
- The program accepts one command-line argument: the hostname of the server you want to connect to.
- It constructs an SSH command with a predefined username and the provided hostname.
- The program then executes the SSH command using the `system()` function and displays the command being executed.
- If any errors occur during execution, they are printed to the standard error stream.

## Usage
To compile the program, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -o sshuc sshuc.c
```

For easy usage move the compiled binary to /usr/bin
```bash
$ sudo mv sshuc /usr/bin
```
Execute
```bash
sshuc <hostname>
```
Replace <hostname> with the address of the server you wish to connect to.

Example:
```bash
sshuc example.com
```
